# PoolMate

PoolMate was created to address the issues of centralized ride-sharing services like Uber and Lyft. These platforms charge high fees and prevent drivers and users from connecting directly. PeerPool seeks to decentralize the process through trustless smart contracts, eliminating the middleman and ensuring user data is secure and private. It offers all the features of traditional ride-sharing services and more.

## How it's Built 

PoolMate is a decentralized application that provides users with a ride-sharing program similar to Uber or Lyft but without a middleman. It uses trustless smart contracts to act as an intermediary and reduce the costs of rides. IPFS, the Ethereum Ecosystem, ReactJS, Express, and Material UI were utilized to build this application. IPFS protocol was used to store user data in a decentralized manner, preventing external access to private information. Ethereum Ecosystem was used to securely store smart contracts to monitor users. ReactJS was used to create the frontend of the application, and Google Maps API was used to display routes. Web Geolocation API was used to determine user location, and Material UI was used to make the application UI and UX friendly. The backend consists of Express with multiple routers to call a single IPFS function and smart contract function for every endpoint.

## Challenges and Accomplishments 

While developing a decentralized application, our team of four encountered various challenges, including a complex Smart Contract backend, unclear error handling, and unfamiliarity with IPFS. However, we managed to develop a functional Dapp using the Ethereum Ecosystem and the IPFS Protocol, which safeguards user data and prevents monopolization by corporations. To overcome the difficulties, we created a custom function to access key-value pairs in a hashmap, utilized IPFS for decentralized file sharing and data storage, and learned to call Smart Contract functions through the frontend using injected Web3 to transfer ether. We are proud of our achievements and attribute our success to effective task delegation, hard work, and perseverance.

## What's next

The application that we built with blockchain technology performs some functionality, but since we couldn’t launch and deploy it to the main network (which would cost some of our own money), it would be the next main thing for PoolMate. We would’ve also loved to add a history feature for our users, so they can review their previous transactions and possible refund them.
